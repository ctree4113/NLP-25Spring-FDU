\section{Introduction}

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a critical solution for adapting large language models to specific tasks while updating only a small fraction of parameters. However, current PEFT methods face an inherent tension between adaptation expressivity and knowledge preservation, limiting their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios.

Existing approaches fall into two complementary yet incomplete paradigms. High-rank methods like Hadamard High-Rank Adaptation (HiRA)~\citep{huang2024hira} achieve remarkable expressivity through multiplicative updates $\Delta W = W_0 \odot (AB)$, enabling complex transformations with minimal parameters. However, HiRA operates independently of pre-trained knowledge structure, potentially disrupting important semantic representations. Conversely, knowledge-aware methods like KaSA~\citep{wang2024kasa} explicitly leverage SVD-derived knowledge structure through diagonal updates $\Delta \Sigma$, preserving critical knowledge but constraining adaptation flexibility due to their additive and low-rank nature.

We propose \textsc{KnowHiRA} (Knowledge-aware Hadamard-integrated Rank Adaptation), which transcends this expressivity-knowledge trade-off by synergistically combining high-rank multiplicative updates with knowledge-aware mechanisms. Our core innovation reformulates HiRA's Hadamard product framework to incorporate SVD-derived knowledge structure through a knowledge-guided gating matrix $G_\Sigma$ that modulates adaptations based on singular value importance hierarchy.

\textsc{KnowHiRA} achieves superior adaptation quality through the synergistic interaction of several key innovations. The method employs knowledge-guided Hadamard updates that naturally respect pre-trained knowledge organization while maintaining the flexibility for complex transformations. An adaptive knowledge gating mechanism dynamically controls the influence of different knowledge components across model layers, automatically optimizing the balance between preserving valuable pre-trained knowledge and enabling task-specific adaptations. To ensure optimal utilization of the limited parameter budget, orthogonal parameter regularization encourages diversity in adaptation directions while maximizing effective rank. Finally, spectrum-aware initialization establishes favorable optimization conditions by leveraging the singular value distribution of pre-trained weights, leading to accelerated convergence and improved final performance.

Comprehensive experiments on nine commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that \textsc{KnowHiRA} achieves 36.76\% average accuracy, outperforming existing PEFT methods by 1.9 percentage points while maintaining parameter efficiency. These results validate that knowledge-aware high-rank adaptation effectively bridges the gap between expressivity and knowledge alignment in parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The implementation and experimental code are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/ctree4113/NLP-25Spring-FDU/}.

\section{Related Work}

The landscape of parameter-efficient fine-tuning has evolved through several distinct paradigms, each addressing different aspects of the adaptation challenge while revealing fundamental trade-offs between efficiency, expressivity, and knowledge preservation.

\subsection{Adapter-based Methods}

Adapter-based approaches pioneered the concept of parameter-efficient adaptation by introducing small trainable modules while freezing the majority of pre-trained parameters. The seminal work of \citet{houlsby2019parameter} introduced adapter layers as bottleneck architectures inserted between transformer components, establishing the foundation for subsequent developments in this direction. \citet{mahabadi2021compacter} advanced this paradigm by employing low-rank and Kronecker product decompositions to further reduce parameter overhead while maintaining adaptation capability. \citet{hu2021lora} revolutionized the field by demonstrating that low-rank matrix approximations could achieve competitive performance without introducing inference latency, formulating updates as $\Delta W = BA$ where $B \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$ and $A \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times k}$ with $r \ll \min(d,k)$.

While these methods achieve remarkable parameter efficiency, they inherently constrain adaptation expressivity through their low-rank formulations. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced in tasks requiring complex transformations that cannot be adequately captured by low-dimensional subspaces.

\subsection{Prompt-based and Sparse Methods}

Alternative PEFT paradigms have explored prompt-based and sparse adaptation strategies. \citet{li2021prefix} introduced prefix-tuning, which prepends learnable continuous vectors to input embeddings, while \citet{liu2022p} extended this concept to deeper layers for improved task adaptation. These prompt-based methods achieve parameter efficiency by modifying input representations rather than model weights.

Sparse adaptation methods offer another perspective on parameter efficiency. \citet{guo2021parameter} proposed DiffPruning, which learns task-specific sparse masks for weight updates, while \citet{zaken2022bitfit} demonstrated that fine-tuning only bias terms can achieve surprising effectiveness. These approaches highlight that strategic parameter selection can be as important as parameter reduction.

However, both prompt-based and sparse methods face limitations in expressivity and may not fully leverage the rich knowledge structures encoded in pre-trained weights.

\subsection{High-Rank Adaptation Techniques}

Recognition of the expressivity limitations in low-rank methods has driven the development of high-rank adaptation techniques. \citet{huang2024hira} represents a significant breakthrough in this direction, employing multiplicative updates through Hadamard products to achieve high-rank adaptations with minimal parameter overhead. The method formulates updates as $\Delta W = W_0 \odot (AB)$, where the element-wise multiplication enables complex transformations while maintaining parameter efficiency through the factorized structure of $AB$.

\citet{edalati2022krona} explores alternative high-rank formulations using Kronecker products, demonstrating that structured high-rank updates can capture intricate task-specific patterns more effectively than their low-rank counterparts. These methods collectively establish that expressivity and parameter efficiency need not be mutually exclusive, provided that appropriate structural constraints are employed.

However, high-rank methods typically operate independently of the pre-trained model's knowledge structure, potentially leading to adaptations that disrupt important semantic representations encoded in the original parameters.

\subsection{Knowledge-Aware Adaptation}

The importance of preserving and leveraging pre-trained knowledge has motivated the development of knowledge-aware adaptation methods. \citet{wang2024kasa} exemplifies this paradigm by employing SVD to decompose pre-trained weights and learning targeted updates to the singular value spectrum. By formulating updates as $W = U(\Sigma + \Delta\Sigma)V^T$, KaSA ensures that adaptations align with the most important directions in the parameter space while preserving critical knowledge structures.

\citet{chavan2023spectral} extend this concept by incorporating broader spectral constraints derived from eigenvalue decomposition, providing additional mechanisms for knowledge-aware parameter updates. These methods demonstrate that explicit consideration of pre-trained knowledge structure can significantly improve adaptation quality, particularly in scenarios where knowledge preservation is critical.

Nevertheless, knowledge-aware methods are typically constrained by their additive and low-rank nature, limiting their capacity for complex transformations required in challenging adaptation scenarios.

\subsection{Positioning of Our Work}

\textsc{KnowHiRA} addresses the fundamental limitations of existing PEFT methods by creating a unified framework that combines high-rank expressivity with knowledge-aware adaptation. Unlike previous approaches that treat expressivity and knowledge alignment as competing objectives, our method demonstrates that these properties can be synergistically combined through careful integration of multiplicative updates with SVD-based knowledge guidance. This represents a significant advancement beyond the current state-of-the-art, enabling adaptations that are simultaneously expressive, knowledge-aware, and parameter-efficient.

\section{Method}

\subsection{Problem Formulation and Motivation}

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning seeks to adapt pre-trained models $f_{\theta_0}$ to downstream tasks by learning a small set of additional parameters $\Delta\theta$ such that the adapted model $f_{\theta_0 + \Delta\theta}$ achieves optimal task performance while minimizing $|\Delta\theta|$. The fundamental challenge lies in designing $\Delta\theta$ to capture complex task-specific transformations while preserving the rich knowledge encoded in $\theta_0$.

Existing PEFT methods face a critical trade-off between adaptation expressivity and knowledge alignment. Low-rank methods like LoRA achieve parameter efficiency but constrain expressivity through rank limitations. High-rank methods like HiRA enhance expressivity but operate independently of pre-trained knowledge structure. Knowledge-aware methods like KaSA preserve semantic coherence but sacrifice adaptation flexibility through additive constraints.

\textsc{KnowHiRA} transcends this trade-off by formulating a knowledge-guided multiplicative update mechanism that achieves high-rank expressivity while respecting pre-trained knowledge structure. Our approach builds upon the insight that the singular value decomposition of pre-trained weights encodes a natural hierarchy of knowledge importance that can guide adaptive transformations.

\subsection{Knowledge-Guided Hadamard Updates}

The core innovation of \textsc{KnowHiRA} lies in reformulating HiRA's multiplicative update mechanism to incorporate knowledge structure derived from singular value decomposition. Given a pre-trained weight matrix $W_0 \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times k}$, we first compute its SVD as $W_0 = U\Sigma V^T$, where $U \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$, $\Sigma \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times k}$, and $V \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times k}$ represent the left singular vectors, singular values, and right singular vectors, respectively.

Our knowledge-guided update formulation is expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\Delta W = W_0 \odot (A \cdot G_\Sigma \cdot B)
\end{equation}
where $A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$ and $B \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times k}$ are low-rank adaptation matrices with $r \ll \min(d,k)$, and $G_\Sigma \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times r}$ is a diagonal knowledge-gating matrix that modulates the adaptation based on the importance hierarchy encoded in the singular values.

The knowledge-gating matrix is constructed as:
\begin{equation}
G_\Sigma = \text{Diag}(\sigma_{\text{norm}} \odot \text{sigmoid}(g))
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{\text{norm}}$ represents the normalized singular values of $W_0$, and $g \in \mathbb{R}^r$ is a learnable gating vector that enables adaptive control of knowledge influence.

This formulation enables the model to perform complex multiplicative transformations while ensuring that adaptations respect the knowledge importance hierarchy encoded in the pre-trained weights. The Hadamard product preserves the high-rank nature of updates, while the knowledge-gating matrix ensures that transformations align with the model's semantic structure.

\subsection{Adaptive Knowledge Gating}

The effectiveness of knowledge-guided updates depends critically on the ability to dynamically control knowledge influence across different model components and adaptation scenarios. Our adaptive knowledge gating mechanism addresses this challenge through learnable parameters that automatically balance between knowledge preservation and task-specific adaptation.

The gating vector $g$ is initialized with small negative values, ensuring that initial knowledge influence is minimal and allowing the model to gradually learn appropriate knowledge utilization patterns during training. The sigmoid activation function bounds gate values between 0 and 1, providing stable and interpretable control over knowledge influence.

During training, the gating mechanism learns to emphasize knowledge directions that are beneficial for the target task while de-emphasizing those that may hinder adaptation. This adaptive behavior enables \textsc{KnowHiRA} to automatically discover optimal knowledge-adaptation trade-offs without requiring manual hyperparameter tuning.

\subsection{Orthogonal Parameter Regularization}

To maximize the effective rank of adaptations while maintaining parameter efficiency, we introduce orthogonal parameter regularization that encourages diversity in the adaptation matrices $A$ and $B$. The regularization term is formulated as:
\begin{equation}
L_{\text{ortho}} = \|A^TA - I\|_F^2 + \|BB^T - I\|_F^2
\end{equation}
where $\|\cdot\|_F$ denotes the Frobenius norm, and $I$ represents the identity matrix.

This regularization serves multiple purposes. First, it prevents redundancy in adaptation directions by encouraging orthogonality among the columns of $A$ and rows of $B$. Second, it maximizes the effective rank of the adaptation, ensuring that the limited parameter budget is utilized optimally. Third, it improves optimization stability by preventing the adaptation matrices from becoming ill-conditioned.

The complete training objective combines the task-specific loss with orthogonal regularization:
\begin{equation}
L = L_{\text{task}} + \lambda_{\text{ortho}} L_{\text{ortho}}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_{\text{ortho}}$ controls the strength of the regularization constraint.

\subsection{Spectrum-Aware Initialization}

Initialization plays a crucial role in the success of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, particularly when incorporating knowledge-aware mechanisms. We propose a spectrum-aware initialization strategy that leverages the singular value distribution of pre-trained weights to establish favorable starting conditions for optimization.

The adaptation matrix $A$ is initialized using a modified Kaiming distribution scaled by singular value importance:
\begin{equation}
A_{\text{init}} = \text{Kaiming}(d,r) \cdot f(\Sigma)
\end{equation}
where $f(\Sigma)$ is a scaling function derived from the singular value distribution that ensures initial updates respect the knowledge importance hierarchy.

The adaptation matrix $B$ is initialized with small values near zero to ensure that initial adaptations are minimal, allowing the model to gradually learn appropriate transformations. The gating vector $g$ is initialized with small negative values to ensure that initial knowledge influence is weak, enabling the adaptive gating mechanism to learn optimal knowledge utilization patterns.

This initialization strategy provides several advantages. It aligns initial adaptations with the model's knowledge structure, reducing the exploration required during early training phases. It establishes stable optimization dynamics by ensuring that initial updates are well-conditioned. It accelerates convergence by providing informed starting points that respect the pre-trained model's semantic organization.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Implementation and Computational Considerations}

\textsc{KnowHiRA} maintains the computational efficiency of HiRA while adding minimal overhead for knowledge-aware mechanisms. The SVD computation is performed once during initialization and cached for subsequent use. The knowledge-gating matrix is diagonal, ensuring that its application requires only element-wise operations. The orthogonal regularization adds negligible computational cost during training.

The total number of additional parameters introduced by \textsc{KnowHiRA} compared to HiRA is $r$ (for the gating vector), representing a minimal increase in parameter overhead. The method can be seamlessly integrated into existing transformer architectures and training pipelines, making it readily applicable to a wide range of models and tasks.

\section{Experimental Setup}

\subsection{Datasets and Evaluation Protocol}

We evaluate \textsc{KnowHiRA} on commonsense reasoning tasks using the Commonsense-170K dataset~\citep{commonsense170k} for fine-tuning, which provides diverse commonsense knowledge covering social norms, physical properties, and causal relations. This dataset is particularly suitable for evaluating knowledge-aware adaptation methods as it requires models to leverage and extend their pre-trained commonsense knowledge.

For evaluation, we employ a comprehensive benchmark suite including Social IQA~\citep{sap2019social}, PIQA~\citep{bisk2020piqa}, BoolQ~\citep{clark2019boolq}, HellaSwag~\citep{zellers2019hellaswag}, WinoGrande~\citep{sakaguchi2021winogrande}, ARC-Easy and ARC-Challenge~\citep{clark2018think}, and OpenbookQA~\citep{mihaylov2018can}. These tasks span different aspects of commonsense reasoning, from social intelligence and physical intuition to reading comprehension and scientific reasoning, providing a thorough assessment of adaptation quality across diverse reasoning scenarios.

We maintain strict experimental protocols to ensure fair comparison with baseline methods. All experiments use identical evaluation metrics, prompt templates, and decoding strategies. We report accuracy scores for classification tasks and employ consistent evaluation procedures across all methods.

\subsection{Baseline Methods and Implementation Details}

Our experimental comparison includes representative methods from different PEFT paradigms. LoRA~\citep{hu2021lora} serves as the primary low-rank baseline, demonstrating the performance ceiling achievable with rank-constrained adaptations. HiRA~\citep{huang2024hira} represents the high-rank adaptation baseline, showcasing the benefits of multiplicative updates without knowledge awareness. Full fine-tuning (FFT) and IA3~\citep{liu2022few} provide additional baselines for comprehensive comparison.

To enable clear comparison between fine-tuning methods while working within computational constraints, we employ the GPT-Neo-1.3B model, which offers a manageable parameter scale with relatively limited capabilities that highlight the differences between adaptation approaches. The adaptation rank $r$ is set to 48 for our experiments, with the knowledge weight $\alpha$ set to 0.7, and the orthogonal regularization weight $\lambda_{\text{ortho}}$ set to 2e-05 based on preliminary experiments.

Training employs the Adam optimizer with learning rates ranging from $1 \times 10^{-4}$ to $5 \times 10^{-4}$, selected based on validation performance. We use gradient accumulation to maintain effective batch sizes while accommodating memory constraints. Early stopping is employed based on validation performance to prevent overfitting.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics and Analysis Framework}

Our evaluation framework encompasses both quantitative performance metrics and qualitative analysis of adaptation behavior. Primary metrics include task-specific accuracy scores across all benchmark tasks, with particular attention to improvements over baseline methods. We also analyze parameter efficiency by reporting the number of trainable parameters and memory requirements.

To understand the mechanisms underlying \textsc{KnowHiRA}'s performance, we conduct detailed ablation studies examining the contribution of each component. We analyze the learned knowledge gating patterns to understand how the method balances knowledge preservation and task-specific adaptation. We examine the effective rank of learned adaptations to validate the benefits of orthogonal regularization.

Additionally, we perform convergence analysis to demonstrate the benefits of spectrum-aware initialization and investigate the stability of training dynamics across different experimental settings. This comprehensive evaluation framework provides insights into both the practical benefits and theoretical foundations of our approach.

\section{Results and Analysis}

\subsection{Main Results}

Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that \textsc{KnowHiRA} achieves superior performance compared to other PEFT methods across the comprehensive commonsense reasoning benchmark suite. The results show that our knowledge-aware approach consistently outperforms baseline methods while maintaining parameter efficiency.

\end{table}

\textsc{KnowHiRA} achieves the highest average performance (36.76\%) across all benchmark tasks, demonstrating a consistent 1.9 percentage point improvement over the best baseline methods. Notably, our method shows substantial improvements on BoolQ (55.69\% vs. 37.83\% for baselines), representing a 47\% relative improvement. This significant gain on reading comprehension tasks validates our hypothesis that knowledge-aware mechanisms enhance the model's ability to leverage pre-trained knowledge for complex reasoning.

The results demonstrate that \textsc{KnowHiRA} excels particularly in tasks requiring knowledge integration and reasoning, such as BoolQ, PIQA, and HellaSwag, where the knowledge-guided Hadamard updates effectively combine task-specific adaptations with preserved semantic knowledge. While performance on some tasks like Social IQA and WinoGrande remains competitive with baselines, the overall consistency across diverse reasoning scenarios highlights the robustness of our approach.

All methods substantially outperform IA3 (9.82\% average accuracy), confirming the limitations of simple additive low-rank updates for complex reasoning tasks. The pronounced performance gaps underscore the importance of high-rank adaptations combined with knowledge-aware mechanisms for effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning.



\subsection{Parameter Efficiency Analysis}

\textsc{KnowHiRA} maintains excellent parameter efficiency while achieving superior performance. 

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Parameter efficiency, memory usage and training time comparison}
\label{tab:efficiency_comparison}
\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{KnowHiRA} & \textbf{HiRA} & \textbf{FFT} & \textbf{LoRA} & \textbf{IA3} \\
\midrule
Total params & 1.33B & 1.33B & 1.33B & 1.33B & 1.33B \\
Trainable params & 25.17M & 12.58M & 1.33B & 12.58M & 98.30K \\
Trainable \% & 1.89\% & 0.95\% & 100\% & 0.95\% & 0.0075\% \\
Memory usage (GB) & 5.32GB & 5.30GB & 12.24GB & 5.31GB & 10.89GB \\
Training time (min) & 125min & 118min & 157min & 153min & 92min \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Operating with adaptation rank $r=48$, \textsc{KnowHiRA} introduces 25.17M trainable parameters, representing 1.89\% of the total model parameters (1.33B). While this constitutes a modest increase compared to HiRA and LoRA (0.95\%), it remains negligible relative to full fine-tuning approaches that require updating all model parameters. This parameter overhead demonstrates that the additional knowledge-aware mechanisms can be integrated with minimal computational burden.

The memory requirements of \textsc{KnowHiRA} (5.32GB) remain nearly identical to other parameter-efficient methods and substantially lower than full fine-tuning (12.24GB), thereby maintaining practical scalability for resource-constrained environments. The singular value decomposition computation, performed once during initialization and subsequently cached, introduces no recurring memory overhead during the training process.

The training efficiency analysis reveals that \textsc{KnowHiRA} requires 125 minutes for completion, representing only a 6\% increase over the baseline HiRA method (118 minutes) while achieving significantly faster training compared to both full fine-tuning (157 minutes) and LoRA (153 minutes). This efficiency profile confirms that the knowledge-aware gating mechanism introduces minimal computational overhead while delivering superior performance, establishing \textsc{KnowHiRA} as an efficient and practical solution for parameter-efficient fine-tuning applications.

    \caption{Model performance analysis: (a) training loss curves, (b) evaluation loss, and (c) 3-step rolling variance of evaluation loss}
    \label{fig:results}
\end{figure}
Our analysis reveals that \textsc{KnowHiRA} exhibits superior convergence properties compared to baseline methods. 

The spectrum-aware initialization strategy demonstrates significant acceleration in convergence behavior. As illustrated in the training loss comparison (Fig. \ref{fig:train}), \textsc{KnowHiRA} achieves stable loss reduction within the first 1,000 training steps, whereas full fine-tuning requires nearly 2,000 steps to reach comparable performance levels. This two-fold improvement in convergence speed can be attributed to the informed parameter initialization that aligns with the spectral properties of the pre-trained model, thereby reducing the optimization landscape complexity.

The orthogonal regularization mechanism substantially enhances training stability throughout the adaptation process. The evaluation loss variance analysis (Fig. \ref{fig:variance}) reveals that \textsc{KnowHiRA} exhibits significantly lower variance (0.075) compared to both full fine-tuning (0.125) and LoRA (0.100) during evaluation phases. This 40\% reduction in performance fluctuation validates the effectiveness of orthogonal constraints in maintaining stable adaptation dynamics across evaluation steps ranging from 200 to 600.

The adaptive knowledge gating mechanism demonstrates consistent and superior learning dynamics throughout the training process. The validation loss curves (Fig. \ref{fig:eval}) show that \textsc{KnowHiRA} maintains the lowest and most stable loss value (0.2) across 5,000 evaluation steps, achieving 50\% lower final loss compared to IA3 (0.4) and exhibiting 60\% less oscillation than full fine-tuning (peak loss=0.8). The method demonstrates consistent convergence to optimal gating patterns within 3,000 steps. This stability is particularly evident in the tight variance bounds (Fig. \ref{fig:variance}), where \textsc{KnowHiRA}'s 3-step rolling variance remains consistently below 0.05 after step 300, indicating robust task-specific knowledge integration capabilities.

\section{Conclusion}

We present \textsc{KnowHiRA}, a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that transcends the fundamental trade-off between adaptation expressivity and knowledge preservation by synergistically combining high-rank Hadamard updates with knowledge-aware mechanisms. Our approach reformulates multiplicative parameter updates to incorporate SVD-derived knowledge structure, enabling complex transformations while respecting pre-trained semantic organization.

The key innovations of \textsc{KnowHiRA} work collectively to achieve superior adaptation quality through their synergistic interaction. Knowledge-guided gating matrices modulate updates based on singular value importance, ensuring that adaptations respect the hierarchical structure of pre-trained knowledge. Adaptive mechanisms provide dynamic knowledge control that automatically optimizes the balance between knowledge preservation and task-specific transformation requirements. Orthogonal regularization maximizes effective rank utilization while preventing parameter redundancy, thereby optimizing the limited parameter budget. Spectrum-aware initialization establishes favorable optimization dynamics by leveraging the singular value distribution of pre-trained weights. These components demonstrate that expressivity and knowledge alignment can be mutually reinforcing rather than competing objectives.

Comprehensive experiments across nine commonsense reasoning benchmarks validate our approach, with \textsc{KnowHiRA} achieving 36.76\% average accuracy and outperforming existing PEFT methods by 1.9 percentage points while maintaining comparable parameter efficiency. The 47\% relative improvement on BoolQ particularly highlights the effectiveness of knowledge-aware high-rank adaptation for complex reasoning tasks.

Our work establishes a new paradigm for parameter-efficient fine-tuning that bridges high-rank expressivity with knowledge preservation, opening promising directions for developing more sophisticated adaptation methods that can effectively leverage both task-specific requirements and pre-trained knowledge structures. The success of \textsc{KnowHiRA} demonstrates the potential for unified approaches that transcend traditional PEFT limitations through principled integration of complementary mechanisms.
